## ðŸ“‹ Document Maintenance

### Content Philosophy
Each document serves a distinct purpose:
- **README.md**: Quick start and overview (executives, new users)
- **IMPLEMENTATION.md**: Technical reference (engineers, implementers)
- **PROJECT-METRICS.md**: Metrics and evolution (stakeholders, managers)
- **LEARNING-JOURNEY.md**: Personal narrative (learners, blog readers)
- **STORAGE.md**: Specialized expertise (operations, storage teams)

### Updates and Contributions
- Technical changes should update **IMPLEMENTATION.md**
- New metrics and insights go in **PROJECT-METRICS.md**
- Personal experiences can enhance **LEARNING-JOURNEY.md**
- Storage improvements belong in **STORAGE.md**
- Quick start changes update **../README.md**
